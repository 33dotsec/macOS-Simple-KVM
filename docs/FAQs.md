## Q: How much disk space do I need?
A: The jumpstart download is ~500MB compressed (2GB uncompressed), the installation files are uncompressed and measure 6.5GB. Bare minimum virtual disk size would be around 20GB, but you'll find it hard to get any apps installed (like Xcode, which is at least 8GB compressed).
